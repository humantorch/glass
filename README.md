Glass puts [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) inside Obsidian with a built-in MCP server that gives Claude direct access to your vault — reading, searching, and writing notes without any configuration on your part. Not a chat UI, not a reimplementation: the actual Claude Code CLI running in a real terminal alongside your notes.

Every slash command, every MCP tool, every session you'd have in a standalone terminal. If you already use Claude Code, there's nothing new to learn.

**Note:** This plugin was formerly called Blackglass. The name has been shortened to Glass; the plugin ID remains `blackglass` so existing installations update seamlessly.

<!-- WHATS-NEW-START -->
## What's new in 1.8.8

- **Stability release** — reverted to the proven 1.8.2 codebase (macOS option key input fix) after remediation attempts introduced checker incompatibilities. No new features, but a reliable, working version.
<!-- WHATS-NEW-END -->

## Features

- **Real Claude Code terminal**: not a chat UI or a wrapper; the actual Claude Code CLI running in a full xterm.js terminal in your sidebar. All slash commands, all MCP tools, full session continuity.
- **Built-in vault MCP server**: gives Claude structured read/write access to your notes the moment the plugin loads; no configuration required
- **Authenticated MCP server**: auto-generated Bearer token written to `.mcp.json` on every launch; any other local process is denied access
- **Read-only vault mode**: optional setting to hide write tools from Claude entirely, limiting it to read and search only
- **Quick ask modal**: one-shot queries using Claude Code's `--print` mode; no terminal required; renders responses as Markdown
- **File explorer context menu**: right-click any `.md` file and choose "Ask Claude about this" to query Claude about it without opening it
- **Vault-aware quick ask**: pre-fill the modal with the active note or selected text
- **Per-query model selector**: choose the model directly in the quick ask modal; overrides the default without changing your setting
- **Session resume**: picks up where you left off (`--continue`) on every open
- **Theme-adaptive terminal**: terminal colors derived from the active Obsidian theme; updates live when you switch themes
- **Cross-platform**: macOS, Linux, and Windows (Windows requires `pip install pywinpty`)

## Requirements

- Obsidian desktop app (1.7.7+)
- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) installed and on your PATH (`claude --version` should work in your terminal)
- Python 3 (used by the terminal bridge; ships with macOS, available via your package manager on Linux; install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on Windows)

**Platform support:** macOS and Linux work out of the box. Windows requires Python 3 and one extra step:

```
pip install pywinpty
```

`pywinpty` is a Python package that provides Windows PTY support, including terminal resize. The Quick Ask modal works on all platforms without it.

**Agent SDK credits:** The Quick Ask modal runs Claude Code in non-interactive (`-p`) mode. As of June 15, 2026, Anthropic bills this separately from interactive usage — Pro plans include $20/month of Agent SDK credits ([details](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan)). The interactive terminal (available on all platforms) draws from your regular Claude subscription, not this pool.

## Installation

Search for **Glass** in Settings → Community Plugins → Browse, then install and enable it.

**Manual install:** Download `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/humantorch/blackglass/releases/latest) and copy them into `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/blackglass/`.

## Commands

All commands are available via the command palette (Cmd+P):

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| Open Claude Code terminal | Opens the sidebar terminal panel |
| Ask Claude (quick) | Opens a quick-ask modal (print mode, no terminal needed) |
| Ask Claude about this note | Prefills the modal with the current note's content |
| Ask Claude about selection | Prefills the modal with the selected text |
| Start new Claude Code session | Kills the current session and starts a clean fresh one |
| Insert note reference into terminal | Opens a note picker and inserts `@<path>` into the terminal; assign a hotkey in Settings → Hotkeys |

A ribbon icon (bot) also opens the terminal panel directly. The terminal toolbar has a **New session** button that starts a completely fresh session, a **Clear** button that wipes the terminal output without ending the session, an **@** button that opens a fuzzy note picker and writes the selected path as a `@filename` reference into the terminal (Claude Code reads the file directly — no content dump), a **settings** button (⚙) that opens Glass settings, and status dots for the session and MCP server (green = active, grey = inactive).

Right-clicking any `.md` file in the file explorer shows an **Ask Claude about this** option, which opens the quick ask modal prefilled with that note's content.

## Settings

Settings → Glass:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Claude binary path | `claude` | Path to the `claude` CLI. Use full path if not on PATH. |
| Working directory | *(vault root)* | Directory Claude starts in. Defaults to vault root. |
| Quick ask model | Default | Model used by the quick ask modal. Can be overridden per-query in the modal itself. |
| Terminal font size | `14` | Font size in pixels. Updates the running terminal immediately. |
| Terminal font family | `monospace` | Font family for the terminal. Populated from your system fonts; falls back to a curated list if font enumeration is unavailable. Updates the running terminal immediately. |
| Terminal font weight | `Normal` | Weight or style variant for the selected font. Options are derived from your system fonts (e.g. Light, Regular, SemiBold, Bold). Updates the running terminal immediately. |
| Terminal scrollback | `5000` | Number of lines kept in scroll history. Takes effect on next terminal open. Valid range: 100–100,000. |
| Open panel on startup | off | Auto-open the terminal when Obsidian launches. |
| Resume last session | on | Passes `--continue` to resume the previous conversation. |
| Enable vault MCP server | on | Starts the built-in MCP server. Disable to run without vault tool access. |
| MCP server port | `27123` | Port the MCP server binds to. Increments automatically if the port is in use. Valid range: 1024-65535. |
| Read-only vault access | off | Hides `create_note` and `update_note` from Claude. Claude can still read and search notes. |
| Skip permission prompts | off | Passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to Claude Code. Claude will execute tool calls without asking for confirmation. Only enable for trusted tasks. |

## Vault MCP server

Glass includes a built-in MCP server that gives the embedded Claude Code session structured access to your vault. When enabled (on by default), the plugin:

1. Starts a local HTTP server on `localhost:27123` (or the next available port)
2. Generates a random Bearer token and writes it alongside the server address into `.mcp.json` so Claude Code authenticates automatically
3. Removes the entry when the plugin unloads

The server requires a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every request. The token is regenerated each time the plugin loads, so any other local process that previously had the token loses access after a restart.

Claude Code gains the following vault tools:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `read_note` | Read a note's full content by vault-relative path |
| `list_notes` | List notes and subfolders at a path (defaults to vault root) |
| `search_vault` | Find notes whose path or filename matches a query string |
| `search_note_content` | Full-text search across note content, returns matching lines with context |
| `get_active_note` | Get the path and content of the currently open note |
| `create_note` | Create a new note at a vault-relative path |
| `update_note` | Replace the content of an existing note |

`search_note_content` accepts an optional `directory` argument to limit the search to a subtree, and an optional `max_results` argument (default 10, max 50). Each result includes up to 3 matching lines with surrounding context so Claude can decide which notes to read in full.

To disable the MCP server, toggle it off in Settings - Glass - "Enable vault MCP server". To use a different port, change the "MCP server port" setting (valid range: 1024-65535). To prevent Claude from writing to your vault, enable "Read-only vault access"; this hides `create_note` and `update_note` from Claude entirely.

**Note:** `.mcp.json` in the vault root is managed by Glass. If you already have a `.mcp.json` with other servers, Glass will merge its `mcpServers.obsidian` entry rather than overwriting the whole file.

## Remote access

Claude Code's built-in `/remote-control` command lets you access your running Glass session from any device where you're signed into Claude — a phone, tablet, or another computer — with no extra install required.

While Glass is open on your desktop:

1. Type `/remote-control` in the terminal
2. Claude Code displays a URL for the remote session
3. Open that URL on any device (any browser, no install)

The vault MCP server keeps running on your desktop, so Claude can still read, search, and write notes from the remote session. You can ask questions about your vault, kick off long tasks, and get results — all from your phone.

**Limitation:** this requires Obsidian to remain open on your desktop machine. Closing the app or putting it to sleep shuts down the MCP server, and vault access from the remote session is lost.

## Network usage

Glass itself communicates only over localhost: the vault MCP server binds to `127.0.0.1` and is never exposed to the network.

The Claude Code CLI that Glass runs is a separate process that sends your prompts and conversation history to [Anthropic's API](https://www.anthropic.com) over HTTPS. This is the same network activity that occurs when you use Claude Code in a terminal. Glass does not transmit any data to Anthropic directly; all API communication is handled by the Claude Code CLI using your own account and API credentials.

## Security

Glass gives Claude Code full shell access in the context of your vault's working directory. This means a note containing adversarial instructions (prompt injection) could (if read into Claude's context via `read_note`, `get_active_note`, or the quick ask commands) attempt to influence Claude's behaviour, including running shell commands.

**What Glass does:** All note content passed to Claude is wrapped in XML-style delimiters with an explicit instruction to treat it as data rather than instructions. This defends against naive and moderately sophisticated injection attempts. It is not a complete solution; a carefully crafted note could attempt to escape the wrapper, but it meaningfully raises the bar.

**What won't protect you:** The **Read-only vault access** setting removes the `create_note` and `update_note` MCP tools, but this is not a meaningful injection defence. A successful injection still has full shell access; it can exfiltrate data via `curl`, write files directly via the filesystem, or run any other shell command. Read-only mode is useful if you want to prevent accidental vault writes during a browsing or query session; it should not be mistaken for a security boundary.

**Recommended practices:**

- Be cautious running "Ask Claude about this" on notes from untrusted sources: web clips, shared vaults, downloaded templates
- The terminal panel is interactive; you see Claude's responses before anything executes, which is a meaningful check on unexpected behaviour

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3
- Claude Code CLI on your PATH

### Steps

```bash
git clone git@github.com:humantorch/blackglass.git
cd blackglass
npm install
npm run build   # Produces main.js
```

Then copy `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` into your vault's plugin directory.

### Releasing

```bash
npm run release:patch   # 0.2.0 → 0.2.1
npm run release:minor   # 0.2.0 → 0.3.0
npm run release:major   # 0.2.0 → 1.0.0
```

Bumps the version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, builds, commits, tags, and creates a GitHub release with `manifest.json` attached. A GitHub Actions workflow then builds the release assets, attests build provenance, and uploads `main.js` and `styles.css`. Requires the `gh` CLI to be authenticated.

### Development loop

```bash
npm run dev   # Watch mode — recompiles on every save
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run lint        # Run Obsidian plugin linter (zero errors = ready to submit)
npm test            # Run tests once
npm run test:watch  # Re-run on file changes
```

Integration tests cover the vault MCP server: auth, all seven tools, read-only mode, port fallback, and HTTP edge cases. Tests spin up a real HTTP server against a mock vault — no Obsidian instance required.

The PTY terminal, xterm.js rendering, and Obsidian plugin lifecycle are not covered by automated tests; verify those manually in the test vault.

Install the [hot-reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) community plugin in a dedicated test vault, symlink this directory into its plugins folder, and the plugin will reload automatically as you edit.

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/test-vault/.obsidian/plugins/
ln -s "$(pwd)" /path/to/test-vault/.obsidian/plugins/blackglass
```

The symlink folder name should match the plugin ID (`blackglass`) so Obsidian can locate it correctly.

**Never use your main vault for development testing.**

### Troubleshooting

**"pywinpty is not installed"**: Windows terminal support requires `pywinpty`. Run `pip install pywinpty` in a terminal, then reload the plugin. If you have multiple Python installs, make sure you're installing into the same Python that Glass finds on your PATH (`where python` will show it).

**"Python 3 not found"**: install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or via Homebrew (`brew install python3`). Python 3 ships with macOS 12.3+; if you're on an older version this may be missing.

**"Session ended with exit code 1" immediately**: Claude is either not on PATH or not found. Obsidian's Electron process does not inherit your full shell PATH. The plugin attempts to supplement PATH with common install locations (`~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, etc.), but if Claude is installed elsewhere the most reliable fix is to set the full path explicitly in Settings → Glass → "Claude binary path" (use `which claude` in your terminal to find it).

**"No previous session found, starting fresh"**: expected on first launch or in a new working directory. The plugin retries automatically without `--continue` and this message can be ignored.

**MCP servers not available inside the plugin**: Electron's process environment does not inherit your full shell profile, so environment variables like `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` are absent by default. The plugin works around this by capturing the full login shell environment at startup (via `zsh -l -c "env"`), which should make any MCP servers that rely on shell-profile variables work automatically. If an MCP tool is still missing, check that the relevant environment variable is exported in your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.zprofile`, etc.) rather than set only in a terminal session.

## Architecture

```
src/
├── main.ts                # Plugin entry, commands, settings load/save
├── types.ts               # Shared interfaces and constants
├── SettingsTab.ts         # Obsidian settings UI
├── ContextBuilder.ts      # Vault context extraction (file content, selection, paths)
├── ProcessManager.ts      # Claude subprocess management (PTY + print mode)
├── ClaudeTerminalView.ts  # xterm.js interactive terminal view
├── ClaudeQuickModal.ts    # One-shot query modal using --print mode
└── VaultMcpServer.ts      # Built-in MCP server exposing vault tools to Claude
```

**Dual-mode design:** The terminal view runs a persistent PTY session (full interactive Claude Code). The quick modal uses `claude --print --output-format json` for one-shot queries without needing an open terminal session.
